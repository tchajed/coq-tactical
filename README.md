# Tactical: a library of Coq proof automation

This library provides some basic tactics to augment the Coq standard library.

Tactical uses the project template from [coq-lib-example](https://github.com/tchajed/coq-lib-example). If you use that template you can include Tactical as a dependency by adding it as a submodule:

`git submodule add https://github.com/tchajed/coq-tactical vendor/tactical`.
