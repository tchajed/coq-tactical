# Tactical: a library of Coq proof automation

[![CI](https://github.com/tchajed/coq-tactical/actions/workflows/coq-action.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tchajed/coq-tactical/actions/workflows/coq-action.yml)

This library provides some basic tactics to augment the Coq standard library.

Tactical uses the project template from [coq-project-template](https://github.com/tchajed/coq-project-template). If you use that template you can include Tactical as a dependency by adding it as a submodule:

`git submodule add https://github.com/tchajed/coq-tactical vendor/tactical`.
